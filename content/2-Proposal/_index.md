# LearnSphere - Smart AI-Powered E-Learning Platform
## Intelligent Online Learning Platform Integrated with AI

### 1. Executive Summary
LearnSphere is a next-generation online learning platform (E-Learning) designed to enhance teaching and learning efficiency in modern educational environments. The platform combines a full-stack web application (React/Vite & Express/MongoDB) with AWS cloud infrastructure (EC2, CloudFront, S3, ECR, AWS Systems Manager, CloudWatch, SNS), CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions, and high-speed Artificial Intelligence powered by the Groq API (LLM Inference Engine). The system supports flexible role-based access control for 3 user groups (Student, Instructor, Admin), integrating key features such as a 24/7 AI Learning Assistant, automated document extraction (PDF/Word/OCR scanned images) to generate smart quizzes, secure multimedia asset storage via S3 Media Bucket, and real-time system metrics monitoring via AWS CloudWatch combined with automated email alerts to Admin via Amazon SNS.

### 2. Problem Statement

#### Current Issues
Traditional E-Learning systems lack personalization and instant support capabilities for students outside of class hours. Instructors spend excessive manual time reading materials, summarizing, and drafting quiz questions for students. Furthermore, lecture documents in PDF format, Word files (.docx), or scanned image documents (OCR) are not automated for lesson data conversion. Operationally, application deployment lacks automation (no CI/CD), and storing large video files directly on servers causes system overload and complicates log management.

#### Solution
LearnSphere implements an optimized AWS production infrastructure architecture (`ap-southeast-1`): Frontend (React/Vite) is statically built, stored on Amazon S3 (`S3 Frontend`), and distributed via Amazon CloudFront CDN. Backend (Express.js) is containerized with Docker, managed on Amazon ECR, and automatically deployed to an Amazon EC2 Instance inside a VPC Public Subnet (via Internet Gateway) using GitHub Actions CI/CD combined with AWS Systems Manager (SSM) and IAM. The database utilizes MongoDB Atlas, while multimedia files and lesson documents are stored on Amazon S3 (`S3 Media`). Smart features integrated with the Groq API LLM Inference combined with text processing libraries (`pdf-parse`, `mammoth`, `tesseract.js` OCR) automate lesson summarization, power the 24/7 AI Tutor, and generate diverse Quiz question banks. The system is closely monitored via AWS CloudWatch (Logs & Alarms), automatically triggering Amazon SNS (`LearnSphere-Alerts`) to dispatch immediate notifications to Admin Gmail upon incident detection.

#### Benefits & Return on Investment (ROI)
- **Time Optimization:** Automates up to 80% of quiz/assignment creation time for instructors.
- **24/7 Learning Support:** Provides a personalized AI learning assistant 24/7 for students.
- **Operating Cost Optimization:** Docker containerization combined with CloudFront and EC2 `t2.micro`/`t3.micro` optimizes operating budgets, with estimated infrastructure costs around $8.30 – $14.80 USD/month (~$99.60 – $177.60 USD for 12 months).
- **Accelerated Deployment:** CI/CD pipeline reduces product deployment time by 90%.
- **Fast Payback:** Clear payback and effectiveness achieved within 1–3 months by saving hundreds of manual labor hours and improving educational quality.

### 3. Solution Architecture
The platform adopts an AWS Cloud Production-ready architecture in region `ap-southeast-1` combined with Docker containerization and CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions. The React frontend interface is distributed via Amazon CloudFront CDN backed by S3 Frontend. The Express.js backend operates on an Amazon EC2 Instance inside a VPC Public Subnet via Internet Gateway, interacting directly with MongoDB Atlas, S3 Media Bucket, Groq API (LLM Inference), and CloudWatch / SNS monitoring systems.

### 7. Risk Assessment

#### Risk Matrix

| Identified Risk | Impact Level | Likelihood |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EC2 Instance Downtime | High | Low |
| OpenAI API Token Budget Overrun | High | Low |
| OCR extraction errors on blurry scan documents | Medium | Medium |
| GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Failure | Medium | Low |

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **EC2 Management:** Configure Docker auto-restart policy (`restart: always`), create CloudWatch Alarm when CPU/RAM exceeds 85%.
- **OpenAI Budget:** Configure Max Tokens limit, apply Rate Limiting on API requests, and cache common AI responses.
- **OCR Documents:** Preprocess text, display warning to users if uploaded file is too blurry.
- **CI/CD & Security:** Test Docker build locally before pushing, enforce AWS IAM least privilege, and store keys in GitHub Secrets.

#### Contingency Plans
- Automatically recover container or restart EC2 via CloudWatch Actions if instance crashes.
- Provide `QuestionBuilder` tool for instructors to manually craft/edit questions when uploaded files cannot be extracted by AI.
